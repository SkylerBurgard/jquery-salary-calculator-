# Project Name

Salary Calculator!

## Description

This is _supposed_ to be a calculator application. This app is meant to allow the use to input two values and select the desired mathematical operation, whilst logging each previous calculation, Although I didn't get that far. The problem I attempted to solve was "How can I build a functioning calculator from the ground up?"? How did I solve it? Well, I didn't, but I tried by first by setting up my folders properly (public folders, server, client.js etc.), then started building out my server and client side first using logic. This did not go all that well for me, but I do think I taught my self a better understanding of the server as taught last week.
